The green light from the communication tower shot up into the sky, and after an unsignaled noise, our instruments finally responded. Data from Base 101 is being transmitted to us, but after transferring a few files, our communication was blocked by something, The readable content in the file is only a few coordinates and one sentence. That sentence is confused, repeat these words, ancestor species, kill, evolution. = 通讯塔运行的绿光射向天空，在一阵无信号的嘈杂声后，我们的仪器终于有了反应。来自101基地的数据正在向我们传输，但在传输了几个文件后，我们的通讯被什么东西阻断了，文件中的可读内容只有几个坐标和一句话。那句话内容混乱，重复这几个词，始祖种、杀死、进化。






Communication established. Surprisingly, there are survivors on the surface. Please protect the World Purification Core—we only have one chance. The fate of the world is in our hands.(Keep parasites away from our cities) = 通讯建立，没想到地表还有幸存者。请保护世界净化核心，我们只有一次机会。世界的命运掌握在我们手中！（不要让寄生虫靠近我们的城市）

Complete the evolutionary battle to rid the world of parasites! = 完成世界进化之战，以将寄生虫从世界中清除！

I do not know when, a strange creature appeared in the world, no one knows where they came from, they seem to suddenly appear. = 不知何时起，一种怪异的生物出现在世界上，没有人知道它们从何而来，它们就好像突然出现一样。

The strange lives seemed to have changed and began to show aggression, leaving a mark of their own on the land they passed. = 那些怪异的生命似乎发生了变化，开始展现出攻击性，它们在所经过的土地上留下了独属于它们的记号。

The life we call parasites is evolving, a tree-like individual is discovered, A large area centered on that particular individual is transformed into an erosion site, with a large number of parasite individuals active around it. = 那些被我们称作寄生虫的生命正在不断演化，一种树状个体被发现，以那个特殊个体为中心的一大片区域都转变为侵蚀地，还有大量寄生虫个体在其周围活跃。

We found an unknown massive individual in the wild, which is completely different from the type we found earlier, and it seems to be managing the eroded area, There are many ground-based parasite individuals guarding the edge of the eroded area. = 我们在野外发现了未知的块状个体，它与我们先前发现的类型完全不同，它似乎在管理那片侵蚀地区，有许多固定在地面的寄生虫个体在守卫侵蚀地区的边缘。

The morphology of those parasites has changed dramatically, and they are beginning to attack us in a major way. We found some information from some of the remains occupied by the parasites at some point. Although only a few pieces, perhaps we can collect a certain number to be able to find something. = 那些寄生虫的形态发生了显著的变化，它们开始向我们大举进犯，一场关系人类存亡的大战将要拉开帷幕。我们从寄生虫占据的一些遗迹中发现了一些不知什么时候留下的信息。虽然只是一些残片，或许我们能够收集到一定数目能够有所发现。

Our war with parasites continues, and the latest discovery is that they are adapting to our attacks, The technical information we collected was studied and the method of building the communication tower was obtained. We were able to contact survivors in other areas and the lost 101 base. = 我们和寄生虫的战争还在继续，最新的发现是它们正在适应我们的攻击，我们收集的技术信息经过研究得到了建造通讯塔的方法，按照信息中所述，在建造多座通讯塔后，我们能够联系上其他地区的幸存者以及失落的101基地。

Parasites have undergone another mass evolution, and we don't know if their evolution will end. If so, what would it be? Our communication with Base 101 was brief, like it was blocked by something. From the hinterland of the parasites came a terrible wave of energy. That should be the communication of the ancestor parasite, and we need to kill it and take the core as a key preparation for the cleansing of the world. = 寄生虫又迎来了一次大规模进化，我们不知道它们的进化有没有尽头。如果有那会是什么？我们与101基地的通讯十分短暂，像是被什么东西阻断了。从寄生虫的腹地传来一股恐怖的能量波动。那应该就是通信中所说的始祖种寄生虫了，我们需要杀死祂取走核心，作为净化世界的关键准备。

The parasite begins to assimilate everything, his tentacles go deep into the core, and his branches cover the sky. The fate of humanity has been like a candle in the wind, our world has come to the last moment. All take up arms and fight the parasites to the end! = 寄生虫开始同化一切，祂的触须深入地核，祂的枝叶遮蔽天空。人类的命运已如风中残烛，我们的世界已经走到最后一刻。所有人拿起武器同寄生虫抗争到最后！

For the first time the parasites show fear, and this time we can actually kill them and drive them out of our world. Our communications with Base 101 are connected again, providing us with a view around the world's cleansing core. The survival of humanity and the fate of the world all depend on the victory or defeat of this war. This battle can only be won! = 耀眼的光芒自城市中心升起，刺破天穹，圣洁的光辉洒向被血肉覆盖的大地。寄生虫第一次表现出了恐惧，这一次我们能够真正的杀死他们，将它们从我们的世界中驱逐出去。我们与101基地的通讯再次接通，为我们提供世界净化核心周围的视野。人类的存亡、世界的命运都取决于这一战的胜败，寄生虫已不再有所保留，全力向世界净化核心发起进攻。此战唯有胜利！

We... we won? The orbital matrix drops thunderstorms, wiping out the parasite's main force. World Purification Core successfully released. The flesh of the parasite-infested soil has become inactive, and all the evidence points to one word - victory. Humans have survived a catastrophe called a parasite, and those who survived are celebrating the joy of surviving. Although the parasites have been eliminated, their traces remain, and we need to recover. = 我们……我们赢了？轨道矩阵降下雷暴，将寄生虫的主力部队尽数消灭。世界净化核心成功释放。被寄生虫侵染的土地上覆盖的血肉已经失去活性，一切证据都指向一个词——胜利。人类度过了名为寄生虫的劫难，幸存下来的人类正在庆祝劫后余生的喜悦。虽然寄生虫已经被消灭，但他们留下的痕迹仍在，一切还需要我们来恢复。
